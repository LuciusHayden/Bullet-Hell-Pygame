# **Bullet-Hell Game**

# Author
Hello, my name is Lucius, this is my second decent sized project. In this project my goal was to get better at using classes as well as learning pygame, the project defiently helped me learn how to use classes in a more useful way and understand them further. I also know the basics of Pygame which I plan on trying to make a few more projects in the future. I have a youtube channel where I post a few small tutorials or showcase what ive made if you want to check that out! I will probably make a video about this project soon.

# Features

This is just a simple game, doesnt really have any special features other than just the base game mechanics, doesnt even have sprites, if you want to use my code you can definetly switch those to sprites. I will talk about how the gameplay works below however.

- Different difficulties which is hardcoded into the game and has to be changed in the code. Easy, Medium, or Hard.

- Depending on how long you survive it will become harder to survive against the incoming projectiles which get faster, hit harder, and are harder to dodge

- A timer to not only tell you how long you made it but also tell you when the difficulty is going to start increasing (30, 45, 60, and 75 seconds in)

- Lives and Health reminder at the top. A basic feature that almost every game has to show you how many lives you have remaining and how much health you have left.

- If a player tries to hide behind the walls of the game they will take continuous damage (1 per 200 ms) until they return to the map. This allows for more interesting ways to escape a bunch of projectiles while stilling having a cost for a 'get out of jail free card'

# Lessons learned

I learned how to use the Pygame module, how to use classes more efficently, and finally it helped me get practice not only writing code but also debugging it which was definetly needed for me. The practical experience will probably help me with many projects in the future (along with the debugging skills and classes) while the knowledge on how to use the Pygame module will probably come in handy for a few of my projects in the future.

# Needed Modules
To install all needed modules, run 'pip install -r requirments.txt' in the terminal 

These are all the modules that are all modules that are imported

- import pygame
- import random
- import math
- import time
